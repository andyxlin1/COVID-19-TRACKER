# COVID-19-TRACKER

John Hopkins stopped reporting daily active and recovered due to the ambiguity within 
the measurements and failure to report from some areas leading to inaccurate data.

Version 1.0 
- Website that displays up to date information about COVID-19 using John Hopkins' databases.
-In table form, it displays the confirmed, recovered, active, and death cases of each day 
for each country
-Used Java, SpringBoot, MySQL, HTML/CSS, Javascript, Maven, HTTP, Hibernate, 
JPA,Thymeleaf, and CSV

Future Updates:
Add an explanation of why recovered and active are inaccurate.

Use a different database besides John Hopkins to find recovered and active data but explain it's inaccuracy.
